        <p>I am a college student at Edgewood College studying Computer Information Systems with a concentration in Data Science and a minor in Business. I am exploring my interests and UI and Front-End development have really been a blast! In my free time I love to play video games and read books. Recently I have bought a <a href='https://www.codecademy.com/profiles/Micmeyers'>Codecademy</a>Pro membership to learn some new programming languages and enhance my skillset!  </p>
        <br>
        <p>This website is a personal project and is used to test out the different skills I have learned!</p>
